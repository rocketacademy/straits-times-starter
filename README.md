# Straits Times Starter Code

This is the starter code for Rocket Academy's Intro to Software Engineering Workshop.

There is a bunch of scaffolding here for a Straits Times clone. Fill in the scaffolding and see how well you can clone Straits Times!

For the purposes of this workshop, you will only need to modify the following files. You can ignore all other files.

* `App.js`
* `App.css`
* Everything in `src/components/*`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
