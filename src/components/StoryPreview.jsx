/**
 * Exercise 2: Create Story Preview
 *
 * You will want to write code within the curly braces of the StoryPreview function and add CSS classes to App.css if necessary.
 * Note that this function must have a return value of valid JSX (combination of HTML and React components).
 *
 * Tools that may be helpful for you. Please feel free to use other tools you find more useful!
 * 1) React Bootstrap Cards https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/cards/. Cards are convenient tools to organise data such as stories.
 * 2) story-data.json. The Rocket team has compiled some story data from the Straits Times on Dec 10, 2019 in a file story-data.json.
 * 3) CSS. Don't forget that you can combine CSS with React Bootstrap components to customise thier look and feel!
 * 4) Fault tolerance. What happens if a storyIndex is passed in that does not have a corresponding element in storyData? How should we handle this?
 *
 * @param {*} props StoryPreview parent components always pass a storyIndex prop to the StoryPreview component.
 * Use props.storyIndex with storyData to get the relevant story data for the story preview.
