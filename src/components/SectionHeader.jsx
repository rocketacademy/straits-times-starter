/**
 * Exercise 1: Create Section Header
 *
 * You will want to write code within the opening and closing <Container> tags below, and add CSS classes to App.css if necessary.
 *
 * Tools that may be helpful for you. Please feel free to use other tools you find more useful!
 * 1) Bootstrap Flex https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/utilities/flex/. Flex enables dynamic positioning on screen, and can be applied with CSS.
 * 2) HTML <span> tag https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_span.asp. This enables different formatting of 2 elements on the same horizontal line.
 * 3) React.JS Props https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html. This allows us to pass in variables from a parent component, making components more reusable.
 * 4) JavaScript Date Object https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp. Convenient built-in JavaScript class to get and format dates.
 *
 * @param {*} props Props stands for properties passed in by the parent component (currently only App.js)
 * See if you can pass in properties from App.js to fill in section header properties such as date, temperature, and ST index here.
 * Properties can be accessed with "props.<property_name>"

const SectionHeader = props => <Container>{/* Your code here */}</Container>;
